##Description
Streamlit application that visualizes molecules and their stereoisomers based on a given SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string. Let's break down what each part of the code is doing:

Import Necessary Libraries:

streamlit (aliased as st) for creating the web app interface.
rdkit for handling chemical information and operations.
PIL (Python Imaging Library), specifically the Image module, for image processing, although it's imported but not used in this script.
Set Up Streamlit Page:

st.set_page_config: Configures the Streamlit page, setting the title of the web page to "Molecule Stereoisomer Viewer".
Create Web App Interface:

st.title: Sets the title of the app displayed on the page.
st.text_input: Creates an input box for users to enter a SMILES string. It's pre-filled with 'CC(C(N)C(O)=O)C' as a default value.
Process SMILES String:

Chem.MolFromSmiles(user_smiles): Converts the user-entered SMILES string into a molecule object using RDKit.
Check Validity of Molecule:

The if statement checks if the molecule object is valid (i.e., the SMILES string could be successfully converted).
Display Original Molecule:

Draw.MolToImage(molecule): Generates an image of the molecule.
st.image: Displays the molecule image in the Streamlit app.
Generate and Display Stereoisomers:

EnumerateStereoisomers.StereoEnumerationOptions: Sets options for stereoisomer enumeration. unique=True ensures that only unique stereoisomers are generated, and tryEmbedding=True attempts to generate a 3D conformation for each isomer.
EnumerateStereoisomers.EnumerateStereoisomers: Generates stereoisomers of the given molecule based on the specified options.
The app then iterates through each stereoisomer, converts them to SMILES format, generates their images, and displays them.
Error Handling:

If the SMILES string is invalid (and thus molecule is None), the app displays an error message prompting the user to enter a valid SMILES string.
This application serves as an educational tool for visualizing the structure of a molecule and its possible stereoisomers based on a SMILES input, which is particularly useful in chemistry and drug design.
